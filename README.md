###10 Pin Bowling Tech Test###

This project is meant to mimic the behaviour of a ten pin bowling game. A player should be able to choose the number of players and abide by the rules of bowling. 

####Specifications####

Write a basic web app that lets you “play” ten pin bowling

It should let you choose a number of players (1-4), and implement the rules of play as defined here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Rules_of_play

Each frame, it should:
1.	Display the current scores, and the scores of all previous frames
2.	Let each player take the right number of shots
3.	Let you enter the number of pins knocked down in each shot

At the end of the game, it should
1.	Display the final scores
2.	Declare the winner

You can use any technologies or third-party gems or libraries you, but dependencies should be easy to install (Bundler is your friend!)

We’re not too bothered about an amazing front-end - functional rather than beautiful is fine, but extra points for correct use of appropriate markup.

####Technologies####
Rspec
Ruby
[Ruby on Rails]


####Demonstration####

The game can be played in irb by requiring ````10pinbowling.rb````

####Summary of Experience####

I was able to create the most basic Ten Pin Bowling game but was unable to turn it into a web app or refine it by adding the specified complexities such as current score and choosing the number of players. I gave myself two days to complete the project.

I chose to focus on the most basic task because I wanted to accomplish the kata myself, without the influence of other kata examples. This ended up taking more time than I anticipated because of my skill level. However, I learned a lot in the process and was careful to keep a detailed record of my logic in my_notes.md. 

I realized halfway through writing the game that my decision would mean I would be unable to achieve the desired tech test result: a web app that plays the game. I understood the consequences but felt it was important to try to immerse myself in the game logic and understand the code I was writing, as well as accurately portraying my skill level. 

When I continue with the tech test (which I hope to do regardless of outcome), I would like to restructure my code to more accurately reflect game play. I would add players and see if I could create frames with their accompanying scores. I would also like to create a Rails version of the game so I can play it online, or maybe even deploy it to heroku so I could use it the next time I'm out bowling!

I really appreciated the opportunity to give this puzzle a try and though I didn't finish the tech test I am grateful for the learning experience.
