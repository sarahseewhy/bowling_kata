10 Pin Bowling

Write a basic web app that lets you “play” ten pin bowling

It should let you choose a number of players (1-4), and implement the rules of play as defined here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Rules_of_play

Each frame, it should:
1.	Display the current scores, and the scores of all previous frames
2.	Let each player take the right number of shots
3.	Let you enter the number of pins knocked down in each shot

At the end of the game, it should
1.	Display the final scores
2.	Declare the winner
